What is the difference between the top (coarsest) level of Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids?

In a Gaussian pyramid, subsequent images are weighted down using a Gaussian average (Gaussian blur) and scaled down. 
Each pixel containing a local average that corresponds to a pixel neighborhood on a lower level of the pyramid. 

A Laplacian pyramid is very similar to a Gaussian pyramid but saves the difference image of the blurred versions between each levels. 
Only the smallest level is not a difference image to enable reconstruction of the high resolution image using the difference images on higher levels.

Higher the pyramid level, smaller the difference. No difference at the top level of the Gaussian and the Laplacian pyramid.

Amplify the finest two levels by a factor of k1 = 1.5 and k2 = 1.9 to get the sharpened reconstruction.
